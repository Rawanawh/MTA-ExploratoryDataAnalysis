### Abstract

The goal of this project is to do an Exploratory Data Analysis to find out the least visited ten stations to starts redesigning gates for the stations. To make the subway tunnels flood- proof by adding sliding doors. To protect the city subway system from flooding to avoid the high costs of repairs after the damage is done.

### Conclusion 

RA Architecture and design found the least visit ten stations to start design and constructions to install the sliding doors to it to prevent the station from being damaged by any future increasing of the water level.
